## Fragile as a rainbow

### Introduction

Headlines say the current pandemic has shone a light on the fragility of institutions and globalization;

Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones. Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.

More than 42% of people surveyed by the US Census Bureau in December reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in December, an increase from 11% the previous year. Data from other surveys suggest that the picture is similar worldwide.Studies and surveys conducted so far in the pandemic consistently show that young people, rather than older people, are most vulnerable to increased psychological distress, perhaps because their need for social interactions are stronger.

According to the Oxford dictionary, “delicate”, “dainty” and “fine” are synonyms of fragile. Just as the same principle that even though it appeared that the youth are more fragile and sensitive in psychological crisis, it is known that they are the main strength to beat the pandemic. Thus, I hope to help them to achieve self-release, making them realize that when we are in a dilima, we are likely on the way to come across the best scenery of our life journey.

We ask visitors to listen to their body, by taking an interior journey, where they can reflect on crystallised convictions such as strong equals beautiful, and perfection is a synonym of happiness.The body, however, will react and pushes us to express even the opposite of what we show, turbulent feelings, and fragility. Being fragile, if exposed, can make you strong – like a rainbow. As you walk through this tunnel of garish colours, the artistic installation will help you explore your emotions and be aware of your vulnerability. “Fragile as a rainbow” is a walk towards consciousness that transforms our behaviour from extroverted and “correct” into introverted but genuine.

This installation is on the highest spot of the Monte Muro at 2332 meters hikers arriving from Antermëia, Rina e Luson meet. Sometimes the least known places that offer a very unique view. Here we also find the border between the municipalities of Luson, San Martino and Marebbe.

### Part 2:Detail Design

In the design material, in order to make the device can be used continuously, we choose wood material to make the wooden frame. We also designed the anchoring structure according to the high mountain wind speed load, and fixed the frame on the site with metal nails and plywood.

####   Construction

Materials are customized at local factories and delivered to the build site, where we calibrate them with ropes so that the constituent parts can be aligned along a certain route.

### Thoughts

As landscape architects, we are concerned with the relationship between structures and the natural environment, hoping to bring people more into the environment to experience and feel the beauty of nature. In our opinion, the landscape installation not only cater to the needs of the users in the space. It can also move people emotionally and help them explore both the nature and their inner world. At the same time, in addition to the extensive training in spatial construction and design expression, we，as young designers,  also gradually hope to be able to further express ourselves in the actual environment and to be able to further improve the actual spatial quality.
